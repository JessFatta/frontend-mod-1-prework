## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
The first point that really resonated with me is understanding that mistakes are essential to learning. My experience so far with Turing has been trial and error. I would never learn or actually retain the information if I didn't spend time making mistakes. Once I finally figure out what I'm working on, I realize that it was all the mistakes that got me there.
The second point that resonated with me was not being afraid to seek help. I think that our slack channel has been my most useful tool (aside from maybe google) because it lets down the barriers associated with afraid of being wrong and instead replaces it with taking the opportunity to learn from others.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
One way I currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset is by believing that I can improve my coding skills with effort and practice. I knew it would be a process and obviously not something acquired overnight, but I didn't realize how measurable my improvement would be when I put in the time and effort every day.
A way I currently do not demonstrate a Growth Mindset according to this article is probably seeking out challenges. So far, everything has been a challenge so I definitely haven't had the time or the desire to search for more other than what is already on my plate.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
My Wells Fargo bank account app uses arrays to categorize my purchases and income. I'm guessing that there is an array that contains all spending and another array that contains all income.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An Array method is something that is built into JavaScript in order to apply unique functions, which changes the array itself. This saves us time because the methods work for us.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
The purpose of a loop is to perform an action a specified number of times without actually having to console.log it separately every single time. It instructs the program to carry out the action however many times you need. We use loops in conjunction with arrays when we want to run the same code for each item/element of an array. We use loops not in conjunction with arrays when counting for example. It helps by logging all the information we need without having to console.log each individual number based on what you set it to.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
ELI5: Loops are like when you eat a bite of food and then you repeat until your plate is empty and dinner is finished.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
I actually felt pretty confident about arrays and loops which made me feel like I am achieving small attainable goals. I was stuck for a little while on having my loop print a different statement depending on age, but I eventually figured it out myself through trial and error and that made me very happy!
