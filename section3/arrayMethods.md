/*
pop() method removes the last element from an array. When you use the command pop() it removes whatever element is the last index and then returns that removed element. In doing so, this changes the length of the array. If you call pop() on an empty array, it returns undefined.


push() method adds more elements to the end of the array. When you use the command push() it adds one or more elements in the last index of the array. In doing so, this changes the length of the array and returns the new length of the array.

shift() method removes the first element (index 0) from an array. When you use the command shift() it removes whatever element is in the first index and then returns that removed element. In doing so, this changes the length of the array.
shift() is just like pop() except shift() removes the first element and pop() removes the last element.
Also, just like with pop() if you call shift() on an empty array, it returns undefined. Lastly, in using shift() it moves all the elements up by one index because the first index (index 0) is now removed.

unshift() method adds more elements to the beginning of the array. When you use the command unshift() it adds one or more elements to the first index of the array. In doing so, it changes the length of the array and then returns the new length of the array. unshift() is just like push() except unshift() adds more elements at the beginning of the array (at index 0) and push() adds elements at the end of the array.

Short definitions:

pop() removes the last element
shift() removes the first element

push() adds to the end
unshift() adds to the beginning
