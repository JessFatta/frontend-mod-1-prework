## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

  * I think that, at the very beginning, I was a little afraid to ask questions and then I think I was asking questions too soon and now I think I am starting to find my happy medium.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

  * To be honest, it was a little frightening at first. I think that I mainly struggled with functions in this section because of the lack of support, which made me second guess myself a lot. It was definitely humbling and I'm still pretty unsure about certain points. However, relying on outside resources is something that I will have to get used to and I imagine I will only get better as using google as a tool.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

  * Conditional statements are used to control and tell the computer what you want it to do.

  * In an app I use, a conditional statement would be "if I enter the correct password, then I am able to log in; if I enter an incorrect password, then I have to try again."

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

  * else if and else

  * if it is sunny outside then return that you need to wear sunscreen
  * else if it is rainy outside then return that you need an umbrella
  * else if it is snowing outside then return that you need a jacket
  * else

  * the computer looks at the first condition, if that condition is true then stop there.
  * if that condition is false, then move to the next condition

  * the computer will continue to go down the line until it finds what is true

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

  * && checks if two conditions are met
  * || checks if one of two conditions are met

  * (I think thats what you're asking me)

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

  * I was very confused about writing a function that takes in two strings and prints a concatenation of those two strings. Honestly, the entire functions section was pretty difficult for me. For some, I had to declare variables for it to work in my console and for others I didn't
