## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

It felt pretty interrupted because I can hardly figure something out in 25 minutes, let alone walk away. However, I think that once I get these functions down, I will be happy to walk away and stretch my legs and rest my brain. However, I did like taking an extended break after a bunch of checkmarks because I feel that if I wasn't keeping track of how long I was sitting in the same spot, I would never eat.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I felt more or less the same. Every time I start my work day, I begin with setting out intentions of what I want to complete that day, whether it be homework, a mod1 prework section, or studying for the assessment. I've always been a to-do list kind of person because it helps me to stay on track and makes me feel good when I have completed a task on my to-do list. I was surprised however how much time I spend working on tasks. Some sections of the prework have gone by way quicker than I imagined, but other sections took me much longer.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An array stores a ordered list that can only be accessed by its corresponding index position where as an object can be accessed by strings and can also store more data within the object about that specific thing

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  I think an array would be fine for a list of students in class unless you wanted to include some extra data and store it for each student, then I would choose object.

  * List of states and their capitals
  Object because you can list each state and then include the capital within the object to help organize.

  * List of things to pack for vacation
  Array because they are all similar items that don't need to have data stored within each item.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  Again, probably just an array unless you wanted to include more data about each Instagram account within each one.

  * List of student names and their cohort
  Object because you can store data based on each individual student regarding their cohort.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  Object would be better because you can input the ingredient information and amount of each ingredient within the object.

  * All my favorite restaurants
  I would probably use an object because it would be easier to retrieve and you could include data within, such as your favorite dish from each restaurant or location of each restaurant.

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

Instagram would have keys such as timestamps, comments, likes, dates, etc.
For example, a key in instagram would be
date: "09/22/21" or likes: 50
further you can increment likes as they come - I learned that the hard way

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
I felt pretty confident with objects but then when we started to get into methods I was very challenged and confused for a while. Especially during the tweet exercise where we had to make incremental number of likes.
