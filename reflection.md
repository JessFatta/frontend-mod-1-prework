1. For one, the SuperLearner Article resonated with me in a way that anyone can be a SuperLearner because everyone has the brainpower to master a new discipline as long as they have the right technique.
From this list, I feel as if I already do a couple things, including viewing learning as a process as well as taking care of my brain. One thing I would like to start doing more of is taking short breaks, early and often. Sometimes I feel as if I get so wrapped up in what I am working on that I don't realize how much time has gone by without me taking a quick break. After reading this article, I learned that taking breaks is crucial to retaining information, rather than just cramming. I think this list is pretty well rounded and not too specific in terms of what makes a SuperLearner so I'm not sure of anything else I would add. Maybe I'll think of more as I continue my learning journey.

2. The three data types I learned in this section are numbers, strings, and booleans. Numbers is pretty obvious in that it consists of numbers, however the main difference is that it only contains numbers.
Strings have a little more freedom because they can consist of letters, special characters, AND numbers. For me, if you aren't just plugging simple math, you would use strings over numbers because you can also assign what the numbers relate to.
Booleans are interesting because it basically answers true or false questions. This data type is most useful when determining if something is correct or not, such as a password.

3. console.log("Hello, World!")

4.
// for single line
/* for multi line */
The purpose of a code comment is to basically add a description of what your code is supposed to do for other collaborators as well as yourself to read.

5. Variables allow us to store values for future use which allows us to save time and be more efficient while writing code
ELI5: a person/place/thing/idea that we will want to repeat more than once

6. Instagram: userName, password, likes
I would say that userName and password are boolean data types because they answer a true or false question. Likes is a number data type because it takes the value and adds one for each like.

7. Concatenation means to combine. In an example of a string data type, concatenation can create statement and sentences in the console log.

8. mazon uses concatenation in their sign in page.
var greeting = "Hello, "
var request = "please sign in"
console.log (greeting + request)

9. What is more common in the real world and in terms of what we will be using throughout my time at Turing: concatenation or interpolation? Are they equally important or one apply more than the other?
